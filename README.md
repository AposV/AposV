- 👋 Hi, my name is Apostolis and I am M.Sc. student in the field of Civil Engineering.
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring ML/DL applications in the following areas: Structural Health Monitoring, Non Destructive Testing, Structural Damage Prediction in built and natural structures.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use major ML libraries such as Tensorflow and how to develop and run software that runs on GPU's
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on designing new applications that take advantage of the pros of machine learning and data driven methods to modernize and improve
the design of large civil projects which will make them more sustainable, resilient, use less resources and, above all, safe to the public.
- 📫 If you are interested in collaborating, you can reach me at urbanskyto@gmail.com
